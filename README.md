# introduction

pet project to understand lua- to be able to config neovim better.

tried my best to encorporate basic special relativity (i think gravity may be buggy still but it doesnt crash at least).

# run

in the terminal, go to the directory, run:
```
love .
```

# config

feel free to change any values in the config file to have a different experience.

additionally, to add more planets, copy the `make_entity` function in main.lua.

# hint

escaping a planet's gravity head on may be difficult. however, if you are able to gain enough energy, you may be able to escape. similarly, to lower to a planet's surface, you might have a hard time spamming main and reverse thrusters. but this can be simply acheived by reducing the kinetic energy slowly.
